<p align="center"> <h1>üëã Hi, my name is Matthew Cross!</h1> </p>

## I just completed Penn's LPS Full Stack Bootcamp and certified as a Full Stack Developer! (Waiting for my certificate)‚åõ & I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy, Politics, & Economics (PPE) in May 2020. üéì

### **User Story**

#### In August 2021, I decided to make a career change so I enrolled in Penn's LPS Full-Stack Bootcamp. üë®‚Äçüíª

#### I knew it would be challenging, but I wasn't expecting the need to push myself harder than in other academic settings. Also, finding the confidence to become a developer was an obstacle, I had trouble asking for help and believing that my code would actually work.

#### Despite this, with the help of Penn's LPS support team and my own perseverance, I found myself evolving into a developer who is excited to take on new challenges as it serves as an opportunity to learn and become better. This growth mindset has become an invaluable skill for me, it's allowed me properly access the problem at hand and calmly analyze the situation to give the best answer, which greatly applies to the workplace.


#### Now looking back as a graduate, I've learned significantly about Frontend and Backend development, plus MYSQL and NoSQL database management/query. Now I'm able to create Full Stack applications using frameworks/tools such as React, Express, OOP, MVC, ORM, Mongoose, Sequelize, and MERN stack. Talk about development!!

#### Currently, I have been keeping up on my skills and growth mindset by learning server-side scripting with Python and creating my own version of Frogger.
