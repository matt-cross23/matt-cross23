### **User Story**

I am a Full-Stack Engineer with two years of hands-on experience in developing both front-end and back-end solutions, specializing in creating user-friendly interfaces, optimizing backend systems, and managing efficient database infrastructures. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Python, and CSS, allowing me to build dynamic applications and ensure seamless API integrations.

In my current role as a Full-Stack Developer at ERPHealth, I lead the development of a HIPAA-compliant SAAS platform that integrates clinical assessments to enhance patient data collection. Iâ€™ve been instrumental in managing project timelines and collaborating with cross-functional teams, ensuring client satisfaction while meeting tight deadlines. My contributions range from streamlining data processes to creating accessible solutions like a text-to-speech feature for both Spanish and English assessments, aimed at improving patient experience. Iâ€™ve also designed an automated marketing report system that delivers critical patient outcome data to clients, helping them gain insights from customizable date ranges.

One of my key strengths is working closely with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I thrive on fostering collaboration, from writing detailed documentation to engaging in product discussions and shaping development strategies. In all my projects, my focus is on efficiency, user experience, and scalability, ensuring that every solution meets both business and user needs.

Before transitioning into tech, I served as a Legal Clerk at the First Judicial District of Philadelphia. In this role, I managed the creation of over 200 payment plans for defendants, ensuring compliance with city regulations and generating over $476,000 in owed revenue. This experience honed my organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to lead under pressureâ€”qualities I now apply to managing complex tech projects.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from the University of Pennsylvania, where I developed critical thinking and analytical skills that complement my technical expertise. Afterward, I completed a 24-week intensive full-stack development program at Pennâ€™s LPS, where I further solidified my knowledge in front-end and back-end technologies.

I am passionate about using my skills to solve real-world problems and am eager to continue developing innovative and efficient software solutions in a dynamic and collaborative team environment.
