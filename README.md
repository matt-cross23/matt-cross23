# 👋 Hi, my name is Matthew Cross! 
## I am recent graduate of a Bachelor's Degree for Philosophy, Politics, Economics (PPE) at the University of Pennsylvania. 🎓
## At the end of Febuary I'll be certified as Full Stack Developer from Penn's LPS Full Stack Bootcamp Program! ☺

### Since graduation I've worked for the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia County) as a legal clerk for the Office of Court Compliance, helping people with outstanding court costs and fines get on a payment plan so they can recieve SNAP benefits. I am also certified as a 200 level excel user by Microsoft 🏛️

#### In August 2021, I decided to make a career change so I enrolled in Penn's LPS Full Stack Bootcamp. 👨‍💻

#### Since then, I've learned significally about Frontend and Backend development, plus MYSQL and NOSQL database management/query.  

#### Here are my Github Stats!
