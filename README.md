# 👋 Hi, my name is Matthew Cross! 
## I am recent graduate of a Bachelor's Degree for Philosophy, Politics, Economics (PPE) at the University of Pennsylvania. 🎓

### Since then I've worked for the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia County) as a legal clerk for the Office of Court Compliance, helping people with outstanding court costs and fines get on a payment plan so they can recieve SNAP benefits.
